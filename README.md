# Forex Strategy Runner (Vite + React + TradingView)

A lightweight React app that renders a TradingView chart (public `tv.js` widget) and drives **real-time** price/strategy UI from **your own backend** (MT5 â†’ FastAPI).  
The chart uses a **custom datafeed** to pull candles and live bars from your server, and the exact same data is mirrored to the rest of the UI via a tiny in-memory bus.

---

## Features

- âš¡ Vite + React + TypeScript
- ðŸ“ˆ TradingView widget with custom datafeed (your server provides data)
- ðŸ”Œ Real-time updates via WebSocket (`/stream/candles`)
- ðŸ§  Shared market bus so **all UI** reads the same live data as the chart
- ðŸ§© Strategy list, prediction card, and signal log (UI scaffolding ready to wire)

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (check with `node -v`)
- A running **FastAPI backend** that provides:
  - `GET /api/candles?symbol=EURUSD&timeframe=H1&limit=1000` â†’ `{ "candles": [{ time, open, high, low, close, volume? }, ...] }`  
    - `time` is **seconds** epoch (the frontend multiplies by `1000` to ms)
  - `WS /stream/candles?symbol=EURUSD&timeframe=H1` â†’ messages like `{ "bar": { time, open, high, low, close } }`
- (Optional) Corporate proxy configured for npm if needed.

> **Note:** TradingViewâ€™s `tv.js` **does not** give you their proprietary data. You must supply data (we do via your backend), which is the correct/allowed way.
